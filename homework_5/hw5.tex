\begin{problem}{1}{3}
\par Two conducting wires in the shape of cylinders of the same cross-sectional area, at 0 $^\circ C$ have resistivities $\rho_{01}$, $\rho_{02}$ and temperature coefficients of resistivity $\alpha_1$ and $\alpha_2$, respectively. What is the effective temperature coefficient of resistivity if the conductors are connected (a) in series, (b) in parallel.
\end{problem}
\vspace{3mm}
\begin{solution}
	\par We may as well assume both the two conducting wires have the same length. Then we denote their resistance
	\begin{align*}
		R_1 & = \rho_{1} \frac{L}{A} \\
		R_2 & = \rho_{2} \frac{L}{A}
	\end{align*}

	Then for \textbf{series}, the cross-sectional area will not change but the length doubles.
	\begin{align*}
		R_s = \rho_s \frac{2L}{A} = R_1 + R_2
	\end{align*}

	Hence
	\begin{align}
		\label{series}
		\rho_s = \frac{\rho_{1} + \rho_{2}}{2}
	\end{align}

	For \textbf{parallel}, the length will not change but the cross-sectional area doubles.
	\begin{align*}
		R_p = \rho_p \frac{L}{2A} = \frac{R_1R_2}{R_1+R_2}
	\end{align*}

	Hence
	\begin{align}
		\rho_p = \frac{2\rho_{1}\rho_{2}}{\rho_{1} + \rho_{2}}
	\end{align}

	While we know
	\begin{align}
		\rho_i = \rho_{0i}(1 + \alpha_i(T - T_0)) \qquad \text{where } i = 1,2
	\end{align}

	Namely
	\begin{align*}
		 & \rho_{0s}(1+\alpha_s(T-T_0)) = \frac{\rho_{01} + \rho_{02}}{2}(1+\alpha_s(T-T_0)) = \frac{\rho_{01}(1+\alpha_1(T-T_0)) + \rho_{02}(1+\alpha_2(T-T_0))}{2}                                        \\
		 & \frac{2\rho_{01}\rho_{02}}{\rho_{01}+\rho_{02}}(1+\alpha_p(T-T_0)) = \frac{2\rho_{01}(1+\alpha_1(T-T_0))\rho_{02}(1+\alpha_2(T-T_0))}{\rho_{01}(1+\alpha_1(T-T_0))+\rho_{02}(1+\alpha_2(T-T_0))}
	\end{align*}

	while $T_0 = 0$,hence
	\begin{align}
		\alpha_s & = \frac{\rho_{01}\alpha_1 + \rho_{02}\alpha_2}{\rho_{01} + \rho_{02}}                                                                                            \\
		\alpha_p & = \frac{\rho_{01}\alpha_2+\rho_{02}\alpha_1+(\rho_{01}+\rho_{02})\alpha_1\alpha_2(T-T_0)}{\rho_{01}+\rho_{02}+\rho_{01}\alpha_1(T-T_0)+\rho_{02}\alpha_2(T-T_0)}
		= \frac{\rho_{01}\alpha_2+\rho_{02}\alpha_1+(\rho_{01}+\rho_{02})\alpha_1\alpha_2T}{\rho_{01}+\rho_{02}+\rho_{01}\alpha_1T+\rho_{02}\alpha_2T}

		\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{hw5_p2_circuit.jpg}

	As the diagram shows, we calculate the parallel resistance with $4\Omega$ and $6\Omega$ being a series first.
	\begin{align*}
		R_{p} = \frac{1}{\frac{1}{9}+\frac{1}{8}+\frac{1}{4+6}} = \frac{360}{121}\ [\Omega]
	\end{align*}

	Then calculate the series
	\begin{align*}
		R_{s} = 3 + \frac{360}{121} = \frac{723}{121} \ [\Omega]
	\end{align*}

	At last calculate the \textbf{equivalent resistance}
	\begin{align}
		R_{eq} = \frac{1}{\frac{1}{20}+\frac{1}{723/121}} = \frac{14460}{3143}\ [\Omega]

	Apparently, it is equivalent to three resistors in serires which are all composed of parallel resistors, shown as follows.

	We then calculate the equivalent resistance separately. \\
	For the left side
	\begin{align*}
		R_{left} = \frac{R}{3}
	\end{align*}
	For the middle part
	\begin{align*}
		R_{middle} = \frac{R}{6}

	For the right side

Four resistors are connected to form a Wheatstone bridge - a circuit that
can be used to measure unknown resistance $X$, provided the resistances of
$N$, $M$ and $P$ are known. The idea of the measurement method is to tune
(with the switches $K_1$ and $K_2$ closed) the variable resistance $M$ so that the
potential difference between points $b$ and $c$ is zero and the galvanometer
does not show any current. The bridge is then said to be balanced. Show
that in this configuration $X = MP/N$.

\begin{problem}{8}{3}
Strictly speaking, the formula $q(t)=Q_{\max } e^{-t / R C}$ implies that an infinite amount of time is required to discharge a capacitor
in a $R-C$ circuit completely. Yet for practical purposes, a capacitor may be considered to be fully discharged after a finite time
$t_{\mathrm{d}}$, defined as the time when the charge on the capacitor $q\left(t_{\mathrm{d}}\right)$ differs from zero by no more than
the charge of one electron.
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
	\item Find $t_{\mathrm{d}}$ if $C=0.92 \mu \mathrm{F}, R=670 \mathrm{k} \Omega$, and $Q_{\max }=7 \mu \mathrm{C}$.
	\item For a given $Q_{\max }$ is the time required to reach this state always the same number of time constants, independent of $R$ and $C .$ Why or why not?
\end{enumerate}
\end{problem}

\begin{solution}
	\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
		\item Plug in the data
		      \begin{align*}
			                        & q_e = Q_{max}^{-\frac{t_d}{RC}} \\
			      \Rightarrow \quad & t_d = 19.36\ [s]
		      \end{align*}
		\item Based on (a)
		      \begin{align}
			      \ln\left( \frac{q_e}{Q_{max}} \right) = -\frac{t_d}{RC}
		      \end{align}
		      Hence we conclude that, $t_d$ does not depend on $R$ or $C$ separately but
		      depend on $RC$ as a whole. Namely, if $RC$ is constant, $t_d$ is also a constant.
